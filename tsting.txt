once upon midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak weary, over many quaint curious volume forgotten lore-- while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly came tapping, some gently rapping, rapping chamber door. "'tis some visitor," i muttered, "tapping chamber door-- only nothing more." ah, distinctly i remember was bleak december, each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon floor. eagerly i wished morrow;--vainly i had sought borrow books surcease sorrow--sorrow lost lenore-- rare radiant maiden whom angels name lenore-- nameless here evermore. silken sad uncertain rustling each purple curtain thrilled me--filled fantastic terrors never felt before; now, still beating heart, i stood repeating "'tis some visiter entreating entrance chamber door-- some late visiter entreating entrance chamber door; is nothing more." presently soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, "sir," said i, "or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; fact is i was napping, gently came rapping, faintly came tapping, tapping chamber door, i scarce was sure i heard you"--here i opened wide door-- darkness nothing more. deep into darkness peering, long i stood wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared dream before; silence was unbroken, stillness gave no token, only word spoken was whispered word, "lenore?" i whispered, echo murmured back word, "lenore!"-- merely nothing more. back into chamber turning, soul within burning, soon again i heard tapping something louder than before. "surely," said i, "surely is something window lattice; let see, then, thereat is mystery explore-- let heart still moment mystery explore;-- 'tis wind nothing more. open here i flung shutter, when, many flirt flutter, stepped stately raven saintly days yore. least obeisance made he; minute stopped stayed he, but, mien lord lady, perched above chamber door-- perched upon bust pallas just above chamber door-- perched, sat, nothing more. then ebony bird beguiling sad fancy into smiling, grave stern decorum countenance wore, "though thy crest shorn shaven, thou," i said, "art sure no craven, ghastly grim ancient raven wandering nightly shore-- tell thy lordly name is night's plutonian shore!" quoth raven, "nevermore." much i marvelled ungainly fowl hear discourse plainly, though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore; cannot help agreeing no living human being ever yet was blessed seeing bird above chamber door-- bird beast upon sculptured bust above chamber door, such name "nevermore." raven, sitting lonely placid bust, spoke only word, its soul word did outpour nothing farther then uttered; feather then fluttered-- till i scarcely more than muttered: "other friends flown before-- morrow _he_ leave me, hopes flown before." then bird said "nevermore." startled stillness broken reply aptly spoken, "doubtless," said i, "what utters is its only stock store, caught some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast followed faster till songs burden bore-- till dirges hope melancholy burden bore 'never--nevermore.'" raven still beguiling sad soul into smiling, straight i wheeled cushioned seat front bird bust door; then, upon velvet sinking, i betook myself linking fancy unto fancy, thinking ominous bird yore-- grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, ominous bird yore meant croaking "nevermore." i sat engaged guessing, no syllable expressing fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into bosom's core; more i sat divining, head ease reclining cushion's velvet lining lamp-light gloated o'er, whose velvet violet lining lamp-light gloating o'er _she_ shall press, ah, nevermore! then, methought, air grew denser, perfumed unseen censer swung seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled tufted floor. "wretch," i cried, "thy god hath lent thee--by these angels hath sent thee respite--respite nepenthe thy memories lenore! quaff, oh quaff kind nepenthe forget lost lenore!" quoth raven, "nevermore." "prophet!" said i, "thing evil!--prophet still, bird devil!-- whether tempter sent, whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, desolate, yet undaunted, desert land enchanted-- home horror haunted--tell truly, i implore-- is there--_is_ balm gilead?--tell me--tell me, i implore!" quoth raven, "nevermore." "prophet!" said i, "thing evil!--prophet still, bird devil! heaven bends above us--by god both adore-- tell soul sorrow laden if, within distant aidenn, shall clasp sainted maiden whom angels name lenore-- clasp rare radiant maiden whom angels name lenore." quoth raven, "nevermore." "be our sign parting, bird fiend!" i shrieked, upstarting-- "get thee back into tempest night's plutonian shore! leave no black plume token lie thy soul has spoken! leave loneliness unbroken!--quit bust above door! take thy beak heart, take thy form off door!" quoth raven, "nevermore." raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting pallid bust pallas just above chamber door; eyes seeming demon's is dreaming lamp-light o'er him streaming throws shadows floor; soul shadow lies floating floor shall lifted--nevermore!  leave host, departed. then soon after arose sir kay missed sir launcelot; then espied had armor horse. now faith i know well grieve some court king arthur; him knights bold, deem is i, beguile them; because armor shield i am sure i shall ride peace. then soon after departed sir kay, thanked host. i laid book down was knock door, stranger came in. i gave him pipe chair, made him welcome. i also comforted him hot scotch whisky; gave him another one; then still another--hoping always story. after fourth persuader, drifted into himself, quite simple natural way: stranger's history i am american. i was born reared hartford, state connecticut--anyway, just over river, country. i am yankee yankees--and practical; yes, nearly barren sentiment, i suppose--or poetry, other words. father was blacksmith, uncle was horse doctor, i was both, along first. then i went over great arms factory learned real trade; learned was it; learned make everything: guns, revolvers, cannon, boilers, engines, sorts labor-saving machinery. why, i could make anything body wanted--anything world, didn't make any difference what; wasn't any quick new-fangled way make thing, i could invent one--and easy rolling off log. i became head superintendent; had couple thousand men under me. well, man like is man is full fight--that goes without saying. couple thousand rough men under one, has plenty sort amusement. i had, anyway. last i met match, i got dose. was during misunderstanding conducted crowbars fellow used call hercules. laid crusher alongside head made everything crack, seemed spring every joint skull made overlap its neighbor. then world went darkness, i didn't feel anything more, didn't know anything --at least while. when i came again, i was sitting under oak tree, grass, whole beautiful broad country landscape myself--nearly. entirely; was fellow horse, looking down me--a fellow fresh picture-book. was old-time iron armor head heel, helmet head shape nail-keg slits it; had shield, sword, prodigious spear; horse had armor on, too, steel horn projecting forehead, gorgeous red green silk trappings hung down around him like bedquilt, nearly ground. "fair sir, ye just?" said fellow. "will i which?" "will ye try passage arms land lady for--" "what are giving me?" i said. "get along back your circus, i'll report you." now does man fall back couple hundred yards then come rushing hard could tear, nail-keg bent down nearly horse's neck long spear pointed straight ahead. i saw meant business, i was tree when arrived. allowed i was property, captive spear. was argument side--and bulk advantage --so i judged best humor him. fixed agreement whereby i was him was hurt me. i came down, started away, i walking side horse. marched comfortably along, through glades over brooks i could remember seen before--which puzzled made wonder--and yet did come any circus sign circus. i gave idea circus, concluded was asylum. never came asylum--so i was stump, may say. i asked him how far were hartford. said had never heard place; i took lie, allowed that. end hour saw far-away town sleeping valley winding river; beyond hill, vast gray fortress, towers turrets, first i had ever seen picture. "bridgeport?" said i, pointing. "camelot," said he. stranger had been showing signs sleepiness. caught himself nodding, now, smiled those pathetic, obsolete smiles his, said: "i find i can't on; come me, i've got written out, can read like." chamber, said: "first, i kept journal; then by, after years, i took journal turned into book. how long ago was!" handed manuscript, pointed place where i should begin: "begin here--i've already told goes before." was steeped drowsiness time. i went door i heard him murmur sleepily: "give good den, fair sir." i sat down fire examined treasure. first part it--the great bulk it--was parchment, yellow age. i scanned leaf particularly saw was palimpsest. under old dim writing yankee historian appeared traces penmanship was older dimmer still--latin words sentences: fragments old monkish legends, evidently. i turned place indicated stranger began read --as follows: tale lost land chapter i camelot "camelot--camelot," said i myself. "i don't seem remember hearing before. name asylum, likely." was soft, reposeful summer landscape, lovely dream, lonesome sunday. air was full smell flowers, buzzing insects, twittering birds, were no people, no wagons, was no stir life, nothing going on. road was mainly winding path hoof-prints it, now then faint trace wheels either side grass--wheels apparently had tire broad one's hand. presently fair slip girl, ten years old, cataract golden hair streaming down over shoulders, came along. around head wore hoop flame-red poppies. was sweet outfit ever i saw, was it. walked indolently along, mind rest, its peace reflected innocent face. circus man paid no attention her; didn't even seem see her. she--she was no more startled fantastic make-up than was used like every day life. was going indifferently might gone couple cows; when happened notice me, _then_ was change! went hands, was turned stone; mouth dropped open, eyes stared wide timorously, was picture astonished curiosity touched fear. stood gazing, sort stupefied fascination, till turned corner wood were lost view. should startled instead other man, was too many me; i couldn't make head tail it. should seem consider spectacle, totally overlook own merits respect, was another puzzling thing, display magnanimity, too, was surprising young. was food thought here. i moved along dream. approached town, signs life began appear. intervals passed wretched cabin, thatched roof, small fields garden patches indifferent state cultivation. were people, too; brawny men, long, coarse, uncombed hair hung down over faces made them look like animals. women, rule, wore coarse tow-linen robe came well below knee, rude sort sandal, many wore iron collar. small boys girls were always naked; nobody seemed know it. these people stared me, talked me, ran into huts fetched families gape me; nobody ever noticed other fellow, except make him humble salutation no response pains. town were some substantial windowless houses stone scattered among wilderness thatched cabins; streets were mere crooked alleys, unpaved; troops dogs nude children played sun made life noise; hogs roamed rooted contentedly about, them lay reeking wallow middle main thoroughfare suckled family. presently was distant blare military music; came nearer, still nearer, soon noble cavalcade wound into view, glorious plumed helmets flashing mail flaunting banners rich doublets horse-cloths gilded spearheads; through muck swine, naked brats, joyous dogs, shabby huts, took its gallant way, its wake followed. followed through winding alley then another,--and climbing, always climbing--till last gained breezy height where huge castle stood. was exchange bugle blasts; then parley walls, where men-at-arms, hauberk morion, marched back forth halberd shoulder under flapping banners rude figure dragon displayed upon them; then great gates were flung open, drawbridge was lowered, head cavalcade swept forward under frowning arches; we, following, soon found ourselves great paved court, towers turrets stretching into blue air four sides; us dismount was going on, much greeting ceremony, running fro, gay display moving intermingling colors, altogether pleasant stir noise confusion. chapter ii king arthur's court moment i got chance i slipped aside privately touched ancient common looking man shoulder said, insinuating, confidential way: "friend, kindness. belong asylum, are just visit something like that?" looked over stupidly, said: "marry, fair sir, seemeth--" "that do," i said; "i reckon are patient." i moved away, cogitating, same time keeping eye any chance passenger right mind might come along give some light. i judged i had found one, presently; i drew him aside said ear: "if i could see head keeper minute--only just minute--" "prithee let me." "let _what_?" "_hinder_ me, then, word please thee better. then went was under-cook could stop gossip, though like another time; comfort very liver know where i got clothes. started away pointed said yonder was was idle enough purpose, was seeking besides, no doubt. was airy slim boy shrimp-colored tights made him look like forked carrot, rest gear was blue silk dainty laces ruffles; had long yellow curls, wore plumed pink satin cap tilted complacently over ear. look, was good-natured; gait, was satisfied himself. was pretty enough frame. arrived, looked over smiling impudent curiosity; said had come me, informed was page. "go 'long," i said; "you ain't more than paragraph." was pretty severe, i was nettled. however, never phazed him; didn't appear know was hurt. began talk laugh, happy, thoughtless, boyish fashion, walked along, made himself old friends once; asked sorts questions myself clothes, never waited answer--always chattered straight ahead, didn't know had asked question wasn't expecting any reply, until last happened mention was born beginning year . made cold chills creep over me! i stopped said, little faintly: "maybe i didn't hear just right. again--and slow. year was it?" "." "! don't look it! come, boy, i am stranger friendless; honest honorable me. are your right mind?" said was. "are these other people right minds?" said were. "and isn't asylum? i mean, isn't place where cure crazy people?" said wasn't. "well, then," i said, "either i am lunatic, something just awful has happened. now tell me, honest true, where am i?" "in king arthur's court." i waited minute, let idea shudder its way home, then said: "and according your notions, year is now?" "--nineteenth june." i felt mournful sinking heart, muttered: "i shall never see friends again--never, never again. born more than thirteen hundred years yet." i seemed believe boy, i didn't know why. _something_ seemed believe him--my consciousness, may say; reason didn't. reason straightway began clamor; was natural. i didn't know how satisfying it, because i knew testimony men wouldn't serve--my reason were lunatics, throw evidence. sudden i stumbled very thing, just luck. i knew only total eclipse sun first half sixth century occurred st june, a.d. , o.s., began minutes after noon. i also knew no total eclipse sun was due _me_ was present year--i.e., . so, i could keep anxiety curiosity eating heart forty-eight hours, i should then find certain whether boy was telling truth not. wherefore, being practical connecticut man, i now shoved whole problem clear mind till its appointed day hour should come, order i might turn attention circumstances present moment, alert ready make most them could made. thing time, is motto--and just play thing is worth, even it's only two pair jack. i made mind two things: was still nineteenth century i was among lunatics couldn't away, i presently boss asylum know reason why; if, other hand, was really sixth century, right, i didn't want any softer thing: i boss whole country inside three months; i judged i start best-educated man kingdom matter thirteen hundred years upward. i'm man waste time after mind's made there's work hand; i said page: "now, clarence, boy--if might happen your name --i'll post little don't mind. is name apparition brought here?" "my master thine? is good knight great lord sir kay seneschal, foster brother our liege king." "very good; on, tell everything." made long story it; part had immediate interest was this: said i was sir kay's prisoner, due course custom i flung into dungeon left scant commons until friends ransomed me--unless i chanced rot, first. i saw last chance had best show, i didn't waste any bother that; time was too precious. page said, further, dinner was ended great hall time, soon sociability heavy drinking should begin, sir kay exhibit before king arthur illustrious knights seated table round, brag exploit capturing me, probably exaggerate facts little, wouldn't good form correct him, over safe, either; when i was done being exhibited, then ho dungeon; he, clarence, find way come see every now then, cheer up, help word friends. word friends! i thanked him; i couldn't less; time lackey came i was wanted; clarence led took off side sat down me. well, was curious kind spectacle, interesting. was immense place, rather naked--yes, full loud contrasts. was very, very lofty; lofty banners depending arched beams girders away floated sort twilight; was stone-railed gallery each end, high up, musicians one, women, clothed stunning colors, other. floor was big stone flags laid black white squares, rather battered age use, needing repair. ornament, wasn't any, strictly speaking; though walls hung some huge tapestries were probably taxed works art; battle-pieces, were, horses shaped like those children cut paper create gingerbread; men them scale armor whose scales are represented round holes--so man's coat looks had been done biscuit-punch. was fireplace big enough camp in; its projecting sides hood, carved pillared stonework, had look cathedral door. along walls stood men-at-arms, breastplate morion, halberds only weapon --rigid statues; is looked like. middle groined vaulted public square was oaken table called table round. was large circus ring; around sat great company men dressed such various splendid colors hurt one's eyes look them. wore plumed hats, right along, except whenever addressed himself directly king, lifted hat trifle just was beginning remark. mainly were drinking--from entire ox horns; few were still munching bread gnawing beef bones. was average two dogs man; these sat expectant attitudes till spent bone was flung them, then went brigades divisions, rush, ensued fight filled prospect tumultuous chaos plunging heads bodies flashing tails, storm howlings barkings deafened speech time; was no matter, dog-fight was always bigger interest anyway; men rose, sometimes, observe better bet it, ladies musicians stretched themselves over balusters same object; broke into delighted ejaculations time time. end, winning dog stretched himself comfortably bone between paws, proceeded growl over it, gnaw it, grease floor it, just fifty others were already doing; rest court resumed previous industries entertainments. rule, speech behavior these people were gracious courtly; i noticed were good serious listeners when anybody was telling anything--i mean dog-fightless interval. plainly, too, were childlike innocent lot; telling lies stateliest pattern most gentle winning naivety, ready willing listen anybody else's lie, believe it, too. was hard associate them anything cruel dreadful; yet dealt tales blood suffering guileless relish made almost forget shudder. i was only prisoner present. were twenty more. poor devils, many them were maimed, hacked, carved, frightful way; hair, faces, clothing, were caked black stiffened drenchings blood. were suffering sharp physical pain, course; weariness, hunger thirst, no doubt; least none had given them comfort wash, even poor charity lotion wounds; yet never heard them utter moan groan, saw them show any sign restlessness, any disposition complain. thought was forced upon me: "the rascals--_they_ served other people day; being own turn, now, were expecting any better treatment than this; philosophical bearing is outcome mental training, intellectual fortitude, reasoning; is mere animal training; are white indians." chapter iii knights table round mainly round table talk was monologues--narrative accounts adventures these prisoners were captured friends backers killed stripped steeds armor. general thing--as far i could make out--these murderous adventures were forays undertaken avenge injuries, nor settle old disputes sudden fallings out; no, rule were simply duels between strangers--duels between people had never even been introduced each other, between whom existed no cause offense whatever. many time i had seen couple boys, strangers, meet chance, simultaneously, "i can lick you," spot; i had always imagined until now sort thing belonged children only, was sign mark childhood; here were these big boobies sticking taking pride clear into full age beyond. yet was something very engaging these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive lovable. did seem brains enough entire nursery, speak, bait fish-hook with; didn't seem mind that, after little, because soon saw brains were needed society like that, indeed marred it, hindered it, spoiled its symmetry--perhaps rendered its existence impossible. was fine manliness observable almost every face; some certain loftiness sweetness rebuked your belittling criticisms stilled them. most noble benignity purity reposed countenance him called sir galahad, likewise king's also; was majesty greatness giant frame high bearing sir launcelot lake. was presently incident centered general interest upon sir launcelot. sign sort master ceremonies, six eight prisoners rose came forward body knelt floor lifted hands toward ladies' gallery begged grace word queen. most conspicuously situated lady massed flower-bed feminine show finery inclined head way assent, then spokesman prisoners delivered himself fellows into hands free pardon, ransom, captivity, death, good pleasure might elect; this, said, was doing command sir kay seneschal, whose prisoners were, having vanquished them single might prowess sturdy conflict field. surprise astonishment flashed face face over house; queen's gratified smile faded name sir kay, looked disappointed; page whispered ear accent manner expressive extravagant derision-- "sir _kay_, forsooth! oh, call pet names, dearest, call marine! twice thousand years shall unholy invention man labor odds beget fellow majestic lie!" every eye was fastened severe inquiry upon sir kay. was equal occasion. got played hand like major--and took every trick. said state case exactly according facts; tell simple straightforward tale, without comment own; "and then," said he, "if ye find glory honor due, ye give unto him is mightiest man hands ever bare shield strake sword ranks christian battle--even him sitteth there!" pointed sir launcelot. ah, fetched them; was rattling good stroke. then went told how sir launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief time gone by, killed seven giants sweep sword, set hundred forty-two captive maidens free; then went further, still seeking adventures, found him (sir kay) fighting desperate fight against nine foreign knights, straightway took battle solely into own hands, conquered nine; night sir launcelot rose quietly, dressed him sir kay's armor took sir kay's horse gat him away into distant lands, vanquished sixteen knights pitched battle thirty-four another; these former nine made swear whitsuntide ride arthur's court yield them queen guenever's hands captives sir kay seneschal, spoil knightly prowess; now here were these half dozen, rest along soon might healed desperate wounds. well, was touching see queen blush smile, look embarrassed happy, fling furtive glances sir launcelot got him shot arkansas, dead certainty. everybody praised valor magnanimity sir launcelot; me, i was perfectly amazed, man, himself, should been able beat down capture such battalions practiced fighters. i said much clarence; mocking featherhead only said: "an sir kay had had time another skin sour wine into him, ye had seen accompt doubled." i looked boy sorrow; i looked i saw cloud deep despondency settle upon countenance. i followed direction eye, saw very old white-bearded man, clothed flowing black gown, had risen was standing table upon unsteady legs, feebly swaying ancient head surveying company watery wandering eye. same suffering look was page's face was observable faces around--the look dumb creatures know must endure make no moan. "marry, shall again," sighed boy; "that same old weary tale hath told thousand times same words, _will_ tell till dieth, every time hath gotten barrel full feeleth exaggeration-mill a-working. god i had died i saw day!" "who is it?" "merlin, mighty liar magician, perdition singe him weariness worketh tale! men fear him hath storms lightnings devils hell beck call, dug entrails these many years ago tale squelch it. telleth always third person, making believe is too modest glorify himself--maledictions light upon him, misfortune dole! good friend, prithee call evensong." boy nestled himself upon shoulder pretended sleep. old man began tale; presently lad was asleep reality; also were dogs, court, lackeys, files men-at-arms. droning voice droned on; soft snoring arose sides supported like deep subdued accompaniment wind instruments. some heads were bowed upon folded arms, some lay back open mouths issued unconscious music; flies buzzed bit, unmolested, rats swarmed softly hundred holes, pattered about, made themselves home everywhere; them sat like squirrel king's head held bit cheese its hands nibbled it, dribbled crumbs king's face naive impudent irreverence. was tranquil scene, restful weary eye jaded spirit. was old man's tale. said: "right king merlin departed, went until hermit was good man great leech. hermit searched wounds gave him good salves; king was three days, then were wounds well amended might ride go, departed. rode, arthur said, i no sword. no force,* [*footnote m.t.: no matter.] said merlin, hereby is sword shall yours i may. rode till came lake, was fair water broad, midst lake arthur was ware arm clothed white samite, held fair sword hand. lo, said merlin, yonder is sword i spake of. saw damsel going upon lake. damsel is that? said arthur. is lady lake, said merlin; within lake is rock, therein is fair place any earth, richly beseen, damsel come anon, then speak ye fair give sword. anon withal came damsel unto arthur saluted him, again. damsel, said arthur, sword is that, yonder arm holdeth above water? i were mine, i no sword. sir arthur king, said damsel, sword is mine, ye give gift when i ask you, ye shall it. faith, said arthur, i give gift ye ask. well, said damsel, ye into yonder barge row yourself sword, take scabbard you, i ask gift when i see time. sir arthur merlin alight, tied horses two trees, went into ship, when came sword hand held, sir arthur took handles, took him. arm hand went under water; came unto land rode forth. then sir arthur saw rich pavilion. signifieth yonder pavilion? is knight's pavilion, said merlin, ye fought last, sir pellinore, is out, is there; hath ado knight yours, hight egglame, fought together, last egglame fled, else had been dead, hath chased him even carlion, shall meet him anon highway. is well said, said arthur, now i sword, now i wage battle him, avenged him. sir, ye shall so, said merlin, knight is weary fighting chasing, ye shall no worship ado him; also, lightly matched knight living; therefore is counsel, let him pass, shall good service short time, sons, after days. also ye shall see day short space ye shall right glad give him your sister wed. when i see him, i ye advise me, said arthur. then sir arthur looked sword, liked passing well. whether liketh better, said merlin, sword scabbard? liketh better sword, said arthur. ye are more unwise, said merlin, scabbard is worth ten sword, while ye scabbard upon ye shall never lose no blood, ye never sore wounded; therefore, keep well scabbard always you. rode into carlion, way met sir pellinore; merlin had done such craft pellinore saw arthur, passed without any words. i marvel, said arthur, knight speak. sir, said merlin, saw not; had seen ye had lightly departed. came unto carlion, whereof knights were passing glad. when heard adventures marveled jeopard person alone. men worship said was merry under such chieftain put person adventure other poor knights did." chapter iv sir dinadan humorist seemed quaint lie was most simply beautifully told; then i had heard only once, makes difference; was pleasant others when was fresh, no doubt. sir dinadan humorist was first awake, soon roused rest practical joke sufficiently poor quality. tied some metal mugs dog's tail turned him loose, tore around around place frenzy fright, other dogs bellowing after him battering crashing against everything came way making altogether chaos confusion most deafening din turmoil; every man woman multitude laughed till tears flowed, some fell chairs wallowed floor ecstasy. was just like many children. sir dinadan was proud exploit could keep telling over over again, weariness, how immortal idea happened occur him; is way humorists breed, was still laughing after everybody else had got through. was set concluded make speech --of course humorous speech. i think i never heard many old played-out jokes strung together life. was worse than minstrels, worse than clown circus. seemed peculiarly sad sit here, thirteen hundred years before i was born, listen again poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes had given dry gripes when i was boy thirteen hundred years afterwards. convinced isn't any such thing new joke possible. everybody laughed these antiquities --but then always do; i had noticed that, centuries later. however, course scoffer didn't laugh--i mean boy. no, scoffed; wasn't anything wouldn't scoff at. said most sir dinadan's jokes were rotten rest were petrified. i said "petrified" was good; i believed, myself, only right way classify majestic ages some those jokes was geologic periods. neat idea hit boy blank place, geology hadn't been invented yet. however, i made note remark, calculated educate commonwealth i pulled through. is no use throw good thing away merely because market isn't ripe yet. now sir kay arose began fire history-mill fuel. was time feel serious, i did. sir kay told how had encountered far land barbarians, wore same ridiculous garb i did--a garb was work enchantment, intended make wearer secure hurt human hands. however had nullified force enchantment prayer, had killed thirteen knights three hours' battle, taken prisoner, sparing life order strange curiosity i was might exhibited wonder admiration king court. spoke time, blandest way, "this prodigious giant," "this horrible sky-towering monster," "this tusked taloned man-devouring ogre", everybody took bosh naivest way, never smiled seemed notice was any discrepancy between these watered statistics me. said trying escape him i sprang into top tree two hundred cubits high single bound, dislodged stone size cow, "all-to brast" most bones, then swore appear arthur's court sentence. ended condemning die noon st; was little concerned stopped yawn before named date. i was dismal state time; indeed, i was hardly enough right mind keep run dispute sprung how i had better killed, possibility killing being doubted some, because enchantment clothes. yet was nothing ordinary suit fifteen-dollar slop-shops. still, i was sane enough notice detail, wit: many terms used most matter-of-fact way great assemblage first ladies gentlemen land made comanche blush. indelicacy is too mild term convey idea. however, i had read "tom jones," "roderick random," other books kind, knew highest first ladies gentlemen england had remained little no cleaner talk, morals conduct such talk implies, clear hundred years ago; fact clear into our own nineteenth century--in century, broadly speaking, earliest samples real lady real gentleman discoverable english history--or european history, matter--may said made appearance. suppose sir walter, instead putting conversations into mouths characters, had allowed characters speak themselves? should had talk rebecca ivanhoe soft lady rowena embarrass tramp our day. however, unconsciously indelicate things are delicate. king arthur's people were aware were indecent i had presence mind enough mention it. were troubled enchanted clothes were mightily relieved, last, when old merlin swept difficulty away them common-sense hint. asked them why were dull--why didn't occur them strip me. half minute i was naked pair tongs! dear, dear, think it: i was only embarrassed person there. everybody discussed me; did unconcernedly i had been cabbage. queen guenever was naively interested rest, said had never seen anybody legs just like mine before. was only compliment i got--if was compliment. finally i was carried off direction, perilous clothes another. i was shoved into dark narrow cell dungeon, some scant remnants dinner, some moldy straw bed, no end rats company. chapter v inspiration i was tired even fears were able keep awake long. when i next came myself, i seemed been asleep very long time. first thought was, "well, astonishing dream i've had! i reckon i've waked only just time keep being hanged drowned burned something.... i'll nap again till whistle blows, then i'll down arms factory hercules." just then i heard harsh music rusty chains bolts, light flashed eyes, butterfly, clarence, stood before me! i gasped surprise; breath almost got away me. "what!" i said, "you here yet? along rest dream! scatter!" only laughed, light-hearted way, fell making fun sorry plight. "all right," i said resignedly, "let dream on; i'm no hurry." "prithee dream?" "what dream? why, dream i am arthur's court--a person never existed; i am talking you, are nothing work imagination." "oh, la, indeed! is dream you're burned to-morrow? ho-ho--answer that!" shock went through was distressing. i now began reason situation was last degree serious, dream no dream; i knew past experience lifelike intensity dreams, burned death, even dream, very far being jest, was thing avoided, any means, fair foul, i could contrive. i said beseechingly: "ah, clarence, good boy, only friend i've got,--for _are_ friend, aren't you?--don't fail me; help devise some way escaping place!" "now hear thyself! escape? why, man, corridors are guard keep men-at-arms." "no doubt, no doubt. how many, clarence? many, i hope?" "full score. may hope escape." after pause --hesitatingly: "and other reasons--and weightier." "other ones? are they?" "well, say--oh, i daren't, indeed daren't!" "why, poor lad, is matter? why blench? why tremble so?" "oh, sooth, is need! i want tell you, but--" "come, come, brave, man--speak out, there's good lad!" hesitated, pulled way desire, other way fear; then stole door peeped out, listening; finally crept close put mouth ear told fearful news whisper, cowering apprehension was venturing upon awful ground speaking things whose very mention might freighted death. "merlin, malice, has woven spell dungeon, bides man these kingdoms desperate enough essay cross its lines you! now god pity me, i told it! ah, kind me, merciful poor boy means thee well; thou betray i am lost!" i laughed only really refreshing laugh i had had some time; shouted: "merlin has wrought spell! _merlin_, forsooth! cheap old humbug, maundering old ass? bosh, pure bosh, silliest bosh world! why, does seem childish, idiotic, chuckle-headed, chicken-livered superstitions ev --oh, damn merlin!" clarence had slumped knees before i had half finished, was like mind fright. "oh, beware! these are awful words! any moment these walls may crumble upon us such things. oh call them back before is too late!" now strange exhibition gave good idea set thinking. everybody here was honestly sincerely afraid merlin's pretended magic clarence was, certainly superior man like ought shrewd enough contrive some way take advantage such state things. i went thinking, worked plan. then i said: "get up. pull yourself together; look eye. know why i laughed?" "no--but our blessed lady's sake, no more." "well, i'll tell why i laughed. because i'm magician myself." "thou!" boy recoiled step, caught breath, thing hit him rather sudden; aspect took was very, very respectful. i took quick note that; indicated humbug didn't need reputation asylum; people stood ready take him word, without that. i resumed.

"and i am burned alive to-morrow." boy shuddered. "at hour?" "at high noon." "now then, i tell say." i paused, stood over cowering lad whole minute awful silence; then, voice deep, measured, charged doom, i began, rose dramatically graded stages colossal climax, i delivered sublime noble way ever i did such thing life: "go back tell king hour i smother whole world dead blackness midnight; i blot sun, shall never shine again; fruits earth shall rot lack light warmth, peoples earth shall famish die, last man!" i had carry boy myself, sunk into such collapse. i handed him over soldiers, went back. chapter vi eclipse stillness darkness, realization soon began supplement knowledge. mere knowledge fact is pale; when come _realize_ your fact, takes color. is difference between hearing man being stabbed heart, seeing done. stillness darkness, knowledge i was deadly danger took itself deeper deeper meaning time; something was realization crept inch inch through veins turned cold. is blessed provision nature times like these, soon man's mercury has got down certain point comes revulsion, rallies. hope springs up, cheerfulness along it, then is good shape something himself, anything can done. when rally came, came bound. i said myself eclipse sure save me, make greatest man kingdom besides; straightway mercury went top tube, solicitudes vanished. i was happy man was world. i was even impatient to-morrow come, i wanted gather great triumph center nation's wonder reverence. besides, business way making me; i knew that. meantime was thing had got pushed into background mind. was half-conviction when nature proposed calamity should reported those superstitious people, such effect want compromise. so, when i heard footsteps coming, thought was recalled me, i said myself, "as sure anything, it's compromise. well, is good, right, i accept; isn't, i mean stand ground play hand is worth." door opened, some men-at-arms appeared. leader said: "the stake is ready. come!" stake! strength went me, i almost fell down. is hard one's breath such time, such lumps come into one's throat, such gaspings; soon i could speak, i said: "but is mistake--the execution is to-morrow." "order changed; been set forward day. haste thee!" i was lost. was no help me. i was dazed, stupefied; i had no command over myself, i only wandered purposely about, like mind; soldiers took hold me, pulled along them, cell along maze underground corridors, finally into fierce glare daylight upper world. stepped into vast enclosed court castle i got shock; first thing i saw was stake, standing center, near piled fagots monk. four sides court seated multitudes rose rank above rank, forming sloping terraces were rich color. king queen sat thrones, most conspicuous figures there, course. note this, occupied second. next second clarence had slipped some place concealment was pouring news into ear, eyes beaming triumph gladness. said: "tis through _me_ change was wrought! main hard i worked it, too. when i revealed them calamity store, saw how mighty was terror did engender, then saw i also was time strike! wherefore i diligently pretended, unto other one, your power against sun could reach its full until morrow; any save sun world, must slain to-day, while your enchantments are weaving lack potency. odsbodikins, was dull lie, most indifferent invention, should seen them seize swallow it, frenzy fright, were salvation sent heaven; while was i laughing sleeve moment, see them cheaply deceived, glorifying god next, was content let meanest creatures instrument saving thy life. ah how happy has matter sped! need sun _real_ hurt--ah, forget that, your soul forget not! only make little darkness--only littlest little darkness, mind, cease that. sufficient. see i spoke falsely,--being ignorant, fancy --and falling first shadow darkness shall see them mad fear; set free make great! thy triumph, now! remember--ah, good friend, i implore thee remember supplication, blessed sun no hurt. _my_ sake, thy true friend." i choked some words through grief misery; much i spare sun; lad's eyes paid back such deep loving gratitude i had heart tell him good-hearted foolishness had ruined sent death. soldiers assisted across court stillness was profound i had been blindfold i should supposed i was solitude instead walled four thousand people. was movement perceptible those masses humanity; were rigid stone images, pale; dread sat upon every countenance. hush continued while i was being chained stake; still continued while fagots were carefully tediously piled ankles, knees, thighs, body. then was pause, deeper hush, possible, man knelt down feet blazing torch; multitude strained forward, gazing, parting slightly seats without knowing it; monk raised hands above head, eyes toward blue sky, began some words latin; attitude droned on, little while, then stopped. i waited two three moments; then looked up; was standing petrified. common impulse multitude rose slowly stared into sky. i followed eyes, sure guns, was eclipse beginning! life went boiling through veins; i was new man! rim black spread slowly into sun's disk, heart beat higher higher, still assemblage priest stared into sky, motionless. i knew gaze turned upon me, next. when was, i was ready. i was most grand attitudes i ever struck, arm stretched pointing sun. was noble effect. could _see_ shudder sweep mass like wave. two shouts rang out, close upon heels other: "apply torch!" "i forbid it!" was merlin, other king. merlin started place--to apply torch himself, i judged. i said: "stay where are. any man moves--even king--before i give him leave, i blast him thunder, i consume him lightnings!" multitude sank meekly into seats, i was just expecting would. merlin hesitated moment two, i was pins needles during little while. then sat down, i took good breath; i knew i was master situation now. king said: "be merciful, fair sir, essay no further perilous matter, lest disaster follow. was reported us your powers could attain unto full strength until morrow; but--" "your majesty thinks report may been lie? _was_ lie." made immense effect; went appealing hands everywhere, king was assailed storm supplications i might bought off any price, calamity stayed. king was eager comply. said: "name any terms, reverend sir, even halving kingdom; banish calamity, spare sun!" fortune was made. i taken him minute, i couldn't stop eclipse; thing was question. i asked time consider. king said: "how long--ah, how long, good sir? merciful; look, groweth darker, moment moment. prithee how long?" "not long. half hour--maybe hour." were thousand pathetic protests, i couldn't shorten any, i couldn't remember how long total eclipse lasts. i was puzzled condition, anyway, wanted think. something was wrong eclipse, fact was very unsettling. wasn't i was after, how was i tell whether was sixth century, nothing dream? dear me, i could only prove was latter! here was glad new hope. boy was right date, was surely th, _wasn't_ sixth century. i reached monk's sleeve, considerable excitement, asked him day month was. hang him, said was _twenty-first_! made turn cold hear him. i begged him make any mistake it; was sure; knew was st. so, feather-headed boy had botched things again! time day was right eclipse; i had seen myself, beginning, dial was near by. yes, i was king arthur's court, i might well make most i could. darkness was steadily growing, people becoming more more distressed. i now said: "i reflected, sir king. lesson, i let darkness proceed, spread night world; whether i blot sun good, restore it, shall rest you. these are terms, wit: shall remain king over your dominions, receive glories honors belong kingship; shall appoint your perpetual minister executive, give services per cent such actual increase revenue over above its present amount i may succeed creating state. i can't live that, i sha'n't ask anybody give lift. is satisfactory?" was prodigious roar applause, midst king's voice rose, saying: "away bonds, set him free! him homage, high low, rich poor, is become king's right hand, is clothed power authority, seat is upon highest step throne! now sweep away creeping night, bring light cheer again, world may bless thee." i said: "that common man should shamed before world, is nothing; were dishonor _king_ any saw minister naked should also see him delivered shame. i might ask clothes brought again--" "they are meet," king broke in. "fetch raiment another sort; clothe him like prince!" idea worked. i wanted keep things were till eclipse was total, otherwise trying again dismiss darkness, course i couldn't it. sending clothes gained some delay, enough. i had make another excuse. i said natural king should change mind repent some extent had done under excitement; therefore i let darkness grow while, end reasonable time king had kept mind same, darkness should dismissed. neither king nor anybody else was satisfied arrangement, i had stick point. grew darker darker blacker blacker, while i struggled those awkward sixth-century clothes. got pitch dark, last, multitude groaned horror feel cold uncanny night breezes fan through place see stars come twinkle sky. last eclipse was total, i was very glad it, everybody else was misery; was quite natural. i said: "the king, silence, still stands terms." then i lifted hands--stood just moment--then i said, most awful solemnity: "let enchantment dissolve pass harmless away!" was no response, moment, deep darkness graveyard hush. when silver rim sun pushed itself out, moment two later, assemblage broke loose vast shout came pouring down like deluge smother blessings gratitude; clarence was last wash, sure.
