during whole dull, dark, soundless day autumn year, when clouds hung oppressively low heavens, i had been passing alone, horseback, through singularly dreary tract country; length found myself, shades evening drew on, within view melancholy house usher. i know how was--but, first glimpse building, sense insufferable gloom pervaded spirit. i insufferable; feeling was unrelieved any half-pleasureable, because poetic, sentiment, mind usually receives even sternest natural images desolate terrible. i looked upon scene before me--upon mere house, simple landscape features domain--upon bleak walls--upon vacant eye-like windows--upon few rank sedges--and upon few white trunks decayed trees--with utter depression soul i can compare no earthly sensation more properly than after-dream reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off veil. was iciness, sinking, sickening heart--an unredeemed dreariness thought no goading imagination could torture into aught sublime. was it--i paused think--what was unnerved contemplation house usher? was mystery insoluble; nor could i grapple shadowy fancies crowded upon i pondered. i was forced fall back upon unsatisfactory conclusion, while, beyond doubt, are combinations very simple natural objects power thus affecting us, still analysis power lies among considerations beyond our depth. was possible, i reflected, mere different arrangement particulars scene, details picture, sufficient modify, perhaps annihilate its capacity sorrowful impression; and, acting upon idea, i reined horse precipitous brink black lurid tarn lay unruffled lustre dwelling, gazed down--but shudder even more thrilling than before--upon remodelled inverted images grey sedge, ghastly tree-stems, vacant eye-like windows. nevertheless, mansion gloom i now proposed myself sojourn some weeks. its proprietor, roderick usher, had been boon companions boyhood; many years had elapsed since our last meeting. letter, however, had lately reached distant part country--a letter him--which, its wildly importunate nature, had admitted no other than personal reply. ms gave evidence nervous agitation. writer spoke acute bodily illness--of mental disorder oppressed him--and earnest desire see me, best, indeed only personal friend, view attempting, cheerfulness society, some alleviation malady. was manner this, much more, was said--it was apparent heart went request--which allowed no room hesitation; i accordingly obeyed forthwith i still considered very singular summons. although, boys, had been even intimate associates, yet i really knew little friend. reserve had been always excessive habitual. i was aware, however, very ancient family had been noted, time mind, peculiar sensibility temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, many works exalted art, manifested, late, repeated deeds munificent yet unobtrusive charity, well passionate devotion intricacies, perhaps even more than orthodox easily recognisable beauties musical science. i had learned, too, very remarkable fact, stem usher race, time-honoured was, had put forth, no period, any enduring branch; other words, entire family lay direct line descent, had always, very trifling very temporary variation, lain. was deficiency, i considered, while running over thought perfect keeping character premises accredited character people, while speculating upon possible influence one, long lapse centuries, might exercised upon other--it was deficiency, perhaps, collateral issue, consequent undeviating transmission, sire son, patrimony name, had, length, identified two merge original title estate quaint equivocal appellation "house usher"--an appellation seemed include, minds peasantry used it, both family family mansion. i said sole effect somewhat childish experiment--that looking down within tarn--had been deepen first singular impression. can no doubt consciousness rapid increase superstition--for why should i term it?--served mainly accelerate increase itself. such, i long known, is paradoxical law sentiments having terror basis. might been reason only, that, when i again uplifted eyes house itself, its image pool, grew mind strange fancy--a fancy ridiculous, indeed, i mention show vivid force sensations oppressed me. i had worked upon imagination really believe whole mansion domain hung atmosphere peculiar themselves immediate vicinity--an atmosphere had no affinity air heaven, had reeked decayed trees, grey wall, silent tarn--a pestilent mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, leaden-hued. shaking off spirit must been dream, i scanned more narrowly real aspect building. its principal feature seemed excessive antiquity. discoloration ages had been great. minute fungi overspread whole exterior, hanging fine tangled web-work eaves. yet was apart any extraordinary dilapidation. no portion masonry had fallen; appeared wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation parts, crumbling condition individual stones. was much reminded specious totality old wood-work has rotted long years some neglected vault, no disturbance breath external air. beyond indication extensive decay, however, fabric gave little token instability. perhaps eye scrutinizing observer might discovered barely perceptible fissure, which, extending roof building front, made its way down wall zigzag direction, until became lost sullen waters tarn. noticing these things, i rode over short causeway house. servant waiting took horse, i entered gothic archway hall. valet, stealthy step, thence conducted me, silence, through many dark intricate passages progress studio master. much i encountered way contributed, i know how, heighten vague sentiments i already spoken. while objects around me--while carvings ceilings, sombre tapestries walls, ebon blackness floors, phantasmagoric armorial trophies rattled i strode, were matters which, such which, i had been accustomed infancy--while i hesitated acknowledge how familiar was this--i still wondered find how unfamiliar were fancies ordinary images were stirring up. staircases, i met physician family. countenance, i thought, wore mingled expression low cunning perplexity. accosted trepidation passed on. valet now threw open door ushered into presence master. room i found myself was very large lofty. windows were long, narrow, pointed, vast distance black oaken floor altogether inaccessible within. feeble gleams encrimsoned light made way through trellised panes, served render sufficiently distinct more prominent objects around; eye, however, struggled vain reach remoter angles chamber, recesses vaulted fretted ceiling. dark draperies hung upon walls. general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, tattered. many books musical instruments lay scattered about, failed give any vitality scene. i felt i breathed atmosphere sorrow. air stern, deep, irredeemable gloom hung over pervaded all. upon entrance, usher rose sofa had been lying full length, greeted vivacious warmth had much it, i first thought, overdone cordiality--of constrained effort ennuye man world. glance, however, countenance, convinced perfect sincerity. sat down; some moments, while spoke not, i gazed upon him feeling half pity, half awe. surely, man had never before terribly altered, brief period, had roderick usher! was difficulty i could bring myself admit identity wan being before companion early boyhood. yet character face had been times remarkable. cadaverousness complexion; eye large, liquid, luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin very pallid, surpassingly beautiful curve; nose delicate hebrew model, breadth nostril unusual similar formations; finely-moulded chin, speaking, its want prominence, want moral energy; hair more than web-like softness tenuity; these features, inordinate expansion above regions temple, made altogether countenance easily forgotten. now mere exaggeration prevailing character these features, expression were wont convey, lay much change i doubted whom i spoke. now ghastly pallor skin, now miraculous lustre eye, above things startled even awed me. silken hair, too, had been suffered grow unheeded, as, its wild gossamer texture, floated rather than fell face, i could not, even effort, connect its arabesque expression any idea simple humanity. manner friend i was once struck incoherence--an inconsistency; i soon found arise series feeble futile struggles overcome habitual trepidancy--an excessive nervous agitation. something nature i had indeed been prepared, no less letter, than reminiscences certain boyish traits, conclusions deduced peculiar physical conformation temperament. action was alternately vivacious sullen. voice varied rapidly tremulous indecision (when animal spirits seemed utterly abeyance) species energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden, self-balanced perfectly modulated guttural utterance, may observed lost drunkard, irreclaimable eater opium, during periods most intense excitement. was thus spoke object visit, earnest desire see me, solace expected afford him. entered, some length, into conceived nature malady. was, said, constitutional family evil, despaired find remedy--a mere nervous affection, immediately added, undoubtedly soon pass off. displayed itself host unnatural sensations. some these, detailed them, interested bewildered me; although, perhaps, terms, general manner narration had weight. suffered much morbid acuteness senses; most insipid food was alone endurable; could wear only garments certain texture; odours flowers were oppressive; eyes were tortured even faint light; were peculiar sounds, these stringed instruments, did inspire him horror. anomalous species terror i found him bounden slave. "i shall perish," said he, "i must perish deplorable folly. thus, thus, otherwise, shall i lost. i dread events future, themselves, results. i shudder thought any, even most trivial, incident, may operate upon intolerable agitation soul. i have, indeed, no abhorrence danger, except its absolute effect--in terror. unnerved--in pitiable condition--i feel period sooner later arrive when i must abandon life reason together, some struggle grim phantasm, fear." i learned, moreover, intervals, through broken equivocal hints, another singular feature mental condition. was enchained certain superstitious impressions regard dwelling tenanted, whence, many years, had never ventured forth--in regard influence whose supposititious force was conveyed terms too shadowy here re-stated--an influence some peculiarities mere form substance family mansion, had, dint long sufferance, said, obtained over spirit--an effect physique grey walls turrets, dim tarn into looked down, had, length, brought upon morale existence. admitted, however, although hesitation, much peculiar gloom thus afflicted him could traced more natural far more palpable origin--to severe long-continued illness--indeed evidently approaching dissolution--of tenderly beloved sister--his sole companion long years--his last only relative earth. "her decease," said, bitterness i can never forget, "would leave him (him hopeless frail) last ancient race ushers." while spoke, lady madeline (for was called) passed slowly through remote portion apartment, and, without having noticed presence, disappeared. i regarded utter astonishment unmingled dread--and yet i found impossible account such feelings. sensation stupor oppressed me, eyes followed retreating steps. when door, length, closed upon her, glance sought instinctively eagerly countenance brother--but had buried face hands, i could only perceive far more than ordinary wanness had overspread emaciated fingers through trickled many passionate tears. disease lady madeline had long baffled skill physicians. settled apathy, gradual wasting away person, frequent although transient affections partially cataleptical character, were unusual diagnosis. hitherto had steadily borne against pressure malady, had betaken herself finally bed; but, closing evening arrival house, succumbed (as brother told night inexpressible agitation) prostrating power destroyer; i learned glimpse i had obtained person thus probably last i should obtain--that lady, least while living, seen no more. several days ensuing, name was unmentioned either usher myself: during period i was busied earnest endeavours alleviate melancholy friend. painted read together; i listened, dream, wild improvisations speaking guitar. thus, closer still closer intimacy admitted more unreservedly into recesses spirit, more bitterly did i perceive futility attempt cheering mind darkness, inherent positive quality, poured forth upon objects moral physical universe, unceasing radiation gloom. i shall ever bear memory many solemn hours i thus spent alone master house usher. yet i should fail any attempt convey idea exact character studies, occupations, involved me, led way. excited highly distempered ideality threw sulphureous lustre over all. long improvised dirges ring ever ears. among other things, i hold painfully mind certain singular perversion amplification wild air last waltz von weber. paintings over elaborate fancy brooded, grew, touch touch, into vagueness i shuddered more thrillingly, because i shuddered knowing why;--from these paintings (vivid images now are before me) i vain endeavour educe more than small portion should lie within compass merely written words. utter simplicity, nakedness designs, arrested overawed attention. ever mortal painted idea, mortal was roderick usher. least--in circumstances then surrounding me--there arose pure abstractions hypochondriac contrived throw upon canvas, intensity intolerable awe, no shadow felt i ever yet contemplation certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries fuseli. phantasmagoric conceptions friend, partaking rigidly spirit abstraction, may shadowed forth, although feebly, words. small picture presented interior immensely long rectangular vault tunnel, low walls, smooth, white, without interruption device. certain accessory points design served well convey idea excavation lay exceeding depth below surface earth. no outlet was observed any portion its vast extent, no torch, other artificial source light was discernible; yet flood intense rays rolled throughout, bathed whole ghastly inappropriate splendour. i just spoken morbid condition auditory nerve rendered music intolerable sufferer, exception certain effects stringed instruments. was, perhaps, narrow limits thus confined himself upon guitar, gave birth, great measure, fantastic character performances. fervid facility impromptus could accounted for. must been, were, notes, well words wild fantasias (for unfrequently accompanied himself rhymed verbal improvisations), result intense mental collectedness concentration i previously alluded observable only particular moments highest artificial excitement. words these rhapsodies i easily remembered. i was, perhaps, more forcibly impressed it, gave it, because, under mystic current its meaning, i fancied i perceived, first time, full consciousness part usher, tottering lofty reason upon throne. verses, were entitled "the haunted palace," ran very nearly, accurately, thus: i. greenest our valleys, good angels tenanted, once fair stately palace-- radiant palace--reared its head. monarch thought's dominion-- stood there! never seraph spread pinion over fabric half fair. ii. banners yellow, glorious, golden, its roof did float flow; (this--all this--was olden time long ago) every gentle air dallied, sweet day, along ramparts plumed pallid, winged odour went away. iii. wanderers happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically lute's well tuned law, round throne, where sitting (porphyrogene!) state glory well befitting, ruler realm was seen. iv. pearl ruby glowing was fair palace door, through came flowing, flowing, flowing sparkling evermore, troop echoes whose sweet duty was sing, voices surpassing beauty, wit wisdom king. v. evil things, robes sorrow, assailed monarch's high estate;

while, like rapid ghastly river, through pale door, hideous throng rush forever, laugh--but smile no more. i well remember suggestions arising ballad, led us into train thought wherein became manifest opinion usher's i mention much account its novelty (for other men* thought thus,) account pertinacity maintained it. opinion, its general form, was sentience vegetable things. but, disordered fancy, idea had assumed more daring character, trespassed, under certain conditions, upon kingdom inorganization. i lack words express full extent, earnest abandon persuasion. belief, however, was connected (as i previously hinted) gray stones home forefathers. conditions sentience had been here, imagined, fulfilled method collocation these stones--in order arrangement, well many fungi overspread them, decayed trees stood around--above all, long undisturbed endurance arrangement, its reduplication still waters tarn. its evidence--the evidence sentience--was seen, said, (and i here started spoke,) gradual yet certain condensation atmosphere own waters walls. result was discoverable, added, silent, yet importunate terrible influence centuries had moulded destinies family, made him i now saw him--what was. such opinions need no comment, i make none. our books--the books which, years, had formed no small portion mental existence invalid--were, might supposed, strict keeping character phantasm. pored together over such works ververt et chartreuse gresset; belphegor machiavelli; heaven hell swedenborg; subterranean voyage nicholas klimm holberg; chiromancy robert flud, jean d'indagine, de la chambre; journey into blue distance tieck; city sun campanella. favourite volume was small octavo edition directorium inquisitorum, dominican eymeric de gironne; were passages pomponius mela, old african satyrs oegipans, over usher sit dreaming hours. chief delight, however, was found perusal exceedingly rare curious book quarto gothic--the manual forgotten church--the vigiliae mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiae maguntinae. i could help thinking wild ritual work, its probable influence upon hypochondriac, when, evening, having informed abruptly lady madeline was no more, stated intention preserving corpse fortnight, (previously its final interment), numerous vaults within main walls building. worldly reason, however, assigned singular proceeding, was i did feel liberty dispute. brother had been led resolution (so told me) consideration unusual character malady deceased, certain obtrusive eager inquiries part medical men, remote exposed situation burial-ground family. i deny when i called mind sinister countenance person whom i met upon staircase, day arrival house, i had no desire oppose i regarded best harmless, no means unnatural, precaution. request usher, i personally aided him arrangements temporary entombment. body having been encoffined, two alone bore its rest. vault placed (and had been long unopened our torches, half smothered its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity investigation) was small, damp, entirely without means admission light; lying, great depth, immediately beneath portion building was own sleeping apartment. had been used, apparently, remote feudal times, worst purposes donjon-keep, and, later days, place deposit powder, some other highly combustible substance, portion its floor, whole interior long archway through reached it, were carefully sheathed copper. door, massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. its immense weight caused unusually sharp grating sound, moved upon its hinges. having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within region horror, partially turned aside yet unscrewed lid coffin, looked upon face tenant. striking similitude between brother sister now first arrested attention; usher, divining, perhaps, thoughts, murmured some few words i learned deceased himself had been twins, sympathies scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. our glances, however, rested long upon dead--for could regard unawed. disease had thus entombed lady maturity youth, had left, usual maladies strictly cataleptical character, mockery faint blush upon bosom face, suspiciously lingering smile upon lip is terrible death. replaced screwed down lid, and, having secured door iron, made our way, toil, into scarcely less gloomy apartments upper portion house. now, some days bitter grief having elapsed, observable change came over features mental disorder friend. ordinary manner had vanished. ordinary occupations were neglected forgotten. roamed chamber chamber hurried, unequal, objectless step. pallor countenance had assumed, possible, more ghastly hue--but luminousness eye had utterly gone out. once occasional huskiness tone was heard no more; tremulous quaver, extreme terror, habitually characterized utterance. were times, indeed, when i thought unceasingly agitated mind was labouring some oppressive secret, divulge struggled necessary courage. times, again, i was obliged resolve into mere inexplicable vagaries madness, i beheld him gazing upon vacancy long hours, attitude profoundest attention, listening some imaginary sound. was no wonder condition terrified--that infected me. i felt creeping upon me, slow yet certain degrees, wild influences own fantastic yet impressive superstitions. was, especially, upon retiring bed late night seventh eighth day after placing lady madeline within donjon, i experienced full power such feelings. sleep came near couch--while hours waned waned away. i struggled reason off nervousness had dominion over me. i endeavoured believe much, i felt, was due bewildering influence gloomy furniture room--of dark tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion breath rising tempest, swayed fitfully fro upon walls, rustled uneasily decorations bed. efforts were fruitless. irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded frame; and, length, sat upon very heart incubus utterly causeless alarm. shaking off gasp struggle, i uplifted myself upon pillows, and, peering earnestly within intense darkness chamber, hearkened--i know why, except instinctive spirit prompted me--to certain low indefinite sounds came, through pauses storm, long intervals, i knew whence. overpowered intense sentiment horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, i threw clothes haste (for i felt i should sleep no more during night,) endeavoured arouse myself pitiable condition into i had fallen, pacing rapidly fro through apartment. i had taken few turns manner, when light step adjoining staircase arrested attention. i presently recognized usher. instant afterwards rapped, gentle touch, door, entered, bearing lamp. countenance was, usual, cadaverously wan--but, moreover, was species mad hilarity eyes--an evidently restrained hysteria whole demeanour. air appalled me--but anything was preferable solitude i had long endured, i even welcomed presence relief. "and seen it?" said abruptly, after having stared him some moments silence--"you then seen it?--but, stay! shall." thus speaking, having carefully shaded lamp, hurried casements, threw freely open storm. impetuous fury entering gust nearly lifted us our feet. was, indeed, tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, wildly singular its terror its beauty. whirlwind had apparently collected its force our vicinity; were frequent violent alterations direction wind; exceeding density clouds (which hung low press upon turrets house) did prevent our perceiving lifelike velocity flew careering points against each other, without passing away into distance. i even exceeding density did prevent our perceiving this--yet had no glimpse moon stars--nor was any flashing forth lightning. under surfaces huge masses agitated vapor, well terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing unnatural light faintly luminous distinctly visible gaseous exhalation hung enshrouded mansion. "you must not--you shall behold this!" said i, shudderingly, usher, i led him, gentle violence, window seat. "these appearances, bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena uncommon--or may ghastly origin rank miasma tarn. let us close casement;--the air is chilling dangerous your frame. here is your favourite romances. i read, shall listen;--and pass away terrible night together." antique volume i had taken was "mad trist" sir launcelot canning; i had called favourite usher's more sad jest than earnest; for, truth, is little its uncouth unimaginative prolixity could had interest lofty spiritual ideality friend. was, however, only book immediately hand; i indulged vague hope excitement now agitated hypochondriac, might find relief (for history mental disorder is full similar anomalies) even extremeness folly i should read. could i judged, indeed, wild overstrained air vivacity hearkened, apparently hearkened, words tale, i might well congratulated myself upon success design. i had arrived well-known portion story where ethelred, hero trist, having sought vain peaceable admission into dwelling hermit, proceeds make good entrance force. here, remembered, words narrative run thus: "and ethelred, was nature doughty heart, was now mighty withal, account powerfulness wine had drunken, waited no longer hold parley hermit, who, sooth, was obstinate maliceful turn, but, feeling rain upon shoulders, fearing rising tempest, uplifted mace outright, and, blows, made quickly room plankings door gauntleted hand; now pulling therewith sturdily, cracked, ripped, tore asunder, noise dry hollow-sounding wood alarmed reverberated throughout forest." termination sentence i started, moment, paused; appeared (although i once concluded excited fancy had deceived me)--it appeared that, some very remote portion mansion, came, indistinctly, ears, might been, its exact similarity character, echo (but stifled dull certainly) very cracking ripping sound sir launcelot had particularly described. was, beyond doubt, coincidence alone had arrested attention; for, amid rattling sashes casements, ordinary commingled noises still increasing storm, sound, itself, had nothing, surely, should interested disturbed me. i continued story: "but good champion ethelred, now entering within door, was sore enraged amazed perceive no signal maliceful hermit; but, stead thereof, dragon scaly prodigious demeanour, fiery tongue, sate guard before palace gold, floor silver; upon wall hung shield shining brass legend enwritten-- entereth herein, conquerer hath bin; slayeth dragon, shield shall win; ethelred uplifted mace, struck upon head dragon, fell before him, gave pesty breath, shriek horrid harsh, withal piercing, ethelred had fain close ears hands against dreadful noise it, like whereof was never before heard." here again i paused abruptly, now feeling wild amazement--for could no doubt whatever that, instance, i did actually hear (although direction proceeded i found impossible say) low apparently distant, harsh, protracted, most unusual screaming grating sound--the exact counterpart fancy had already conjured dragon's unnatural shriek described romancer. oppressed, i certainly was, upon occurrence second most extraordinary coincidence, thousand conflicting sensations, wonder extreme terror were predominant, i still retained sufficient presence mind avoid exciting, any observation, sensitive nervousness companion. i was no means certain had noticed sounds question; although, assuredly, strange alteration had, during last few minutes, taken place demeanour. position fronting own, had gradually brought round chair, sit face door chamber; thus i could partially perceive features, although i saw lips trembled were murmuring inaudibly. head had dropped upon breast--yet i knew was asleep, wide rigid opening eye i caught glance profile. motion body, too, was variance idea--for rocked side side gentle yet constant uniform sway. having rapidly taken notice this, i resumed narrative sir launcelot, thus proceeded: "and now, champion, having escaped terrible fury dragon, bethinking himself brazen shield, breaking enchantment was upon it, removed carcass way before him, approached valorously over silver pavement castle where shield was upon wall; sooth tarried full coming, fell down feet upon silver floor, mighty great terrible ringing sound." no sooner had these syllables passed lips, than--as shield brass had indeed, moment, fallen heavily upon floor silver--i became aware distinct, hollow, metallic, clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. completely unnerved, i leaped feet; measured rocking movement usher was undisturbed. i rushed chair sat. eyes were bent fixedly before him, throughout whole countenance reigned stony rigidity. but, i placed hand upon shoulder, came strong shudder over whole person; sickly smile quivered lips; i saw spoke low, hurried, gibbering murmur, unconscious presence. bending closely over him, i length drank hideous import words. "not hear it?--yes, i hear it, heard it. long--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, i heard it--yet i dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch i am!--i dared not--i dared speak! put living tomb! said i senses were acute? i now tell i heard first feeble movements hollow coffin. i heard them--many, many days ago--yet i dared not--i dared speak! now--to-night--ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking hermit's door, death-cry dragon, clangour shield!--say, rather, rending coffin, grating iron hinges prison, struggles within coppered archway vault! oh whither shall i fly? here anon? is hurrying upbraid haste? i heard footsteps stair? i distinguish heavy horrible beating heart? madman!" here sprang furiously feet, shrieked syllables, effort were giving soul--"madman! i tell now stands without door!" superhuman energy utterance had been found potency spell--the huge antique panels speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon instant, ponderous ebony jaws. was work rushing gust--but then without those doors did stand lofty enshrouded figure lady madeline usher. was blood upon white robes, evidence some bitter struggle upon every portion emaciated frame. moment remained trembling reeling fro upon threshold,--then, low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon person brother, violent now final death-agonies, bore him floor corpse, victim terrors had anticipated. chamber, mansion, i fled aghast. storm was still abroad its wrath i found myself crossing old causeway. suddenly shot along path wild light, i turned see whence gleam unusual could issued; vast house its shadows were alone behind me. radiance was full, setting, blood-red moon now shone vividly through once barely-discernible fissure i before spoken extending roof building, zigzag direction, base. while i gazed, fissure rapidly widened--there came fierce breath whirlwind--the entire orb satellite burst once upon sight--my brain reeled i saw mighty walls rushing asunder--there was long tumultuous shouting sound like voice thousand waters--and deep dank tarn feet closed sullenly silently over fragments "house usher".
