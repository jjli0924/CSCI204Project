# CSCI204Project
Project for 204
CheckPoint 1
Katie Lunceford

I worked with Jon Li on this Checkpoint.
My answers to the questions are in docstrings in the documents.

To run the program, just run main.py and it will ask for an input file.


Checkpoint 2
I worked with Jon Li again for this checkpoint. However, we had a really hard time connecting the UserGUI to the plotting class that uses matplotlib. It seemed like we were getting an error that crashed python every time we tried to import matplotlib and tkinter together, so I am not sure what to do about that.
